<h1>Relationships with other disciplines</h1>

Engineers, scientists and technicians at work on target positioner inside National Ignition Facility (NIF) target chamber
There exists an overlap between the sciences and engineering practice; in engineering, one applies science. 
Both areas of endeavor rely on accurate observation of materials and phenomena. Both use mathematics and classification criteria to analyze and
 communicate observations.</li><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>

<li><b> Medicine and Biology</b> <BR> The study of the human body, albeit from different directions and for different purposes, is an important common 
link between medicine and some engineering disciplines. Medicine aims to sustain, repair, enhance and even replace functions of the human body,
 if necessary, through the use of technology.
<br>
Modern medicine can replace several of the body's functions through the use of artificial organs and can significantly alter the function of the
 human body through artificial devices such as, for example, brain implants and pacemakers. The fields of bionics and medical bionics are
 dedicated to the study of synthetic implants pertaining to natural systems.</LI><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>

<LI><b>Art</b><br>There are connections between engineering and art, for example, architecture, landscape architecture and industrial design
 (even to the extent that these disciplines may sometimes be included in a university's Faculty of Engineering).<BR>

The Art Institute of Chicago, for instance, held an exhibition about the art of NASA's aerospace design. Robert Maillart's bridge design is perceived by
 some to have been deliberately artistic.<BR> At the University of South Florida, an engineering professor, through a grant with the National Science
 Foundation, has developed a course that connects art and engineering.<BR>

Among famous historical figures, Leonardo da Vinci is a well-known Renaissance artist and engineer, and a prime example of the nexus between art and engineering
<BR><BR><BR><BR>
<li><B>Business</b><BR>Business Engineering deals with the relationship between professional engineering, IT systems, business administration and change 
management. Engineering management or "Management engineering" is a specialized field of management concerned with engineering practice or the engineering 
industry sector.</li>
<BR><BR><BR><BR>
<LI><B> Other Fields</b><br>In political science, the term engineering has been borrowed for the study of the subjects of social engineering and political 
engineering, which deal with forming political and social structures using engineering methodology coupled with political science principles.
 Financial engineering has similarly borrowed the term</li></OL>
