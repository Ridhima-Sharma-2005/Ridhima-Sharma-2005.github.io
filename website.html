        <h1>ENGINEERING</h1>
        <p>Engineering is the use of scientific principles to design and build machines, structures, and other items, including bridges, tunnels, roads, vehicles, and buildings.</p>
        <p>The term engineering is derived from the Latin ingenium, meaning "cleverness" and ingeniare, meaning "to contrive, devise"</p>

        <h1>HISTORY OF ENGINEERING</h1>
        <p>Engineering has existed since ancient times, when humans devised inventions such as the wedge, lever, wheel, and pulley, etc.</p>
        <p>The term engineering is derived from the word engineer, which itself dates back to the 14th century when an engineer (literally, one who builds or operates a siege engine) referred to "a constructor of military engines." In this context, now obsolete, an "engine" referred to a military machine, i.e., a mechanical contraption used in war (for example, a catapult). Notable examples of the obsolete usage which have survived to the present day are military engineering corps, e.g., the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.</p>
        <p>The word "engine" itself is of even older origin, ultimately deriving from the Latin ingenium (c. 1250), meaning "innate quality, especially mental power, hence a clever invention."</p>
        <p>Later, as the design of civilian structures, such as bridges and buildings, matured as a technical discipline, the term civil engineering entered the lexicon as a way to distinguish between those specializing in the construction of such non-military projects and those involved in the discipline of military engineering.</p>
